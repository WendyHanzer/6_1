##Overview

This is showing off the lighting in OpenGl. The menu can switch the shaders, and change objects. 
To add more shaders build them and put them in the shaders folder, then add a new menu in the shaders
submenu. Also in the menu function add in the load shader case for that new shader. 

###Extra Credit####
- Multiple Spot Lights
- All spot lights are controllable and can toggle between them.
- Swapping Between Per Vertex Lighting and Per Fragment Lighting

##Helpful Hints
- Right Click to Pull up a menu
- Some lighting effects are easier seen when using the Earth Object

##Compile and Run
Makefile is built for a Linux system.
  
	cd build
	make
